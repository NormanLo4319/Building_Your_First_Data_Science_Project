# First Data Science Project
This repository guide new data scientists to build their first data science project and setting up CI/CD pipeline so that it can keep the model and application continuously updated as business needs evolve.

## Building a Data Science Project:
1. Has a definite start and end 
2. Deliver something of tangilbe value
3. Deliver something unique for project stakeholders

## Differences Between Software Engineer and Data Scientist:
It's often the case that people are confused about the different between software engineers and data scientists. There are many overlapping tools and technologies, so we want to clarify the different between the two here. 

Software Engineer: 
- Building product that is deterministic in its behavior, e.g. messenger that ensure all messages are delivered 100%.
- Response to users need and request. Modify or create produce based on demand from users.

Data Scientist: 
- Building product that is based on probabilistic system that learns and improves over times, e.g. system that filters spam mails, which does not guarentee to block 100% of spam mails, but could improve over times.
- Analyze data for patterns and create new add-value features.

## Data Science Project:
When building a data science project, we need to make sure the project is fesiable and scalable to benefit all stakeholders of the project.  Here are some creterias for building a data science project.

- Has a definite start and end
- Delivers something of tangilbe value
- Delivers something unique for project stakeholders

## Let's get started!
To start a data science project, we have a list of tools that we applied in this project, which is not limited to future projects. Then, we introduce a general development cycle to build a valuable and actionable data science project.

### Tools for Building the First Project:
- Python
- HTML
- Flask server
- GitHub
- Heroku

### Development Cycle
Phrase 1: Understand business objective for building the product and ability to improve direct-marketing efficiency
- Determine business objectives
- Assess situation
- Determine data mining goals
- Product project plan

Phrase 2: Understand the dataset for analyzing any trend or pattern
- Collect initial data
- Describe data
- Explore data
- Verify data quality
- Define inputs and outcomes

Phrase 3: Data preparation for modeling
- Select data
- Clean data
- Construct data
- Integrate data
- Format data

Phrase 4: Modeling
- Select modeling techniques
- Generate test design
- Build model
- Assess model

Phrase 5: Evaluation
- Evaluate results
- Plan monitoring and maintenance
- Produce final report
- Review project
